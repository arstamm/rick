- This is a website that simulates a game similar to Dance Dance Revolution, except for this is on the computer. There are three players: aswd, arrow, and the mouse. aswd and the arrows are both trying to get the "Dances Moves" right while the Mouse is an agent of Chaos and is there to mess the dancers up.
